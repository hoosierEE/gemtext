* Gemtext
Gemtext is a simple markup language, like Markdown but stripped down to the essentials.

Despite this simplicity, some aspects remained unclear to me so I wrote a translator (compiler?) from gemtext to html.
I used Go for the first translator, which has the benefit of being able to produce a statically linked binary file.
This will be the reference implementation and I plan to reimplement the same translator in other languages.

The translator needs to be able to work with files on the operating system and perform the core task of transforming strings to different strings.
