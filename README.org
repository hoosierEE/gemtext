* Gemtext
A markup language similar to Markdown but with fewer features. Gemtext only supports markup for paragraphs, links, unordered lists, blockquotes, and preformatted text.

Despite its simplicity, some specifics were unclear to me so I wrote a translator/compiler from gemtext to html.
My first implementation is in Go, and I plan to reimplement the same program in other languages as a way to get familiar with other languages.
